# Greasemonkey Userscripts
Collection of UserScripts I've made

### EveryNoise Scan Continue
Lets you press N on the keyboard to skip to the next song, instead of having to scroll to the top of the page each time.

### Auto Refresh VRChat Friends List Page (And Turn On Push Notifs)
Automatically refreshes the friends list page on VRChat.com, since it loves to randomly disconnect you. Also automatically re-enables push notifications since that doesn't get saved for some reason.

### Reddit Auto-Click Expand Buttons
Automatically expands every post in a subreddit. Written in 10 minutes, probably doesn't work anymore.
